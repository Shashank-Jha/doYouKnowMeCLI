**_Shashank_** does'nt know me well ðŸ˜¢, But Do You?

## Features

I have used _JavaScript(node.js)_ to build this simple **meQuiz** app

**_To make the CLI look Beautiful_**, I have used :

1. **_chalk_**
1. **_figlet_**

**npm modules**

# Requirements:

- Node.js

# Installation

If you want to install and run the app locally on your system, then you need to setup _node.js_ first.

##

Now, clone this repository as:

```
git clone https://github.com/Shashank-Jha/doYouKnowMeCLI.git

```

Then, install the required **node modules**

```
npm install
```

Finally, run the **game** ðŸ˜€

```
node index.js
```

**Thanks for Playing my Game** ðŸ¤
